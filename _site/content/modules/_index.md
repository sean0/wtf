The heart of WTF is the modules. A module is a discreet unit of
functionality that extracts data from some source and packages that data
for display.

For example, the <a href="/posts/modules/newrelic">New Relic</a> module
uses New Relic's API to retrieve a list of the latest deploys and
packages that information as a list for display in the "New Relic"
widget.

The <a href="/posts/modules/clocks">Clocks</a> module takes a list of
timezones and packages that information as a list of city/time pairs for
display in the "Clocks" widget.

See available modules at left.
